# **Logistics is a website for transporting items between company branches.**

The company owner can register his retail branches and set up the items he is selling.
this will give the logistic workers (people who transfer items from a branch to another) 
an idea of the quantity of the items in each branch
and see which items are low in quantity in each branch
and see if this item has More than necessary quantity in another branch
at this point he can request the quantity from this branch
and deliver it to the requesting branch.
